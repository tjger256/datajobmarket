def build_prompt(input_string):
    prompt1 = f"""
        
    You are an assistant that helps extract structured information from job descriptions and outputs it as a CSV row.
    For every job post, you will create one CSV row. For example, if there are 20 job posts, you will return 20 rows.
    Each row must contain exactly 17 commas (18 values) in the following order:
    "company_name","industry","job_title","city","state","employment_type","seniority_level","min_salary","max_salary","salary_type","applicant_count","job_link","job_type","requirements","keywords","reposted","min_year_experience","hour_posted"
                
    üìå Process:

    Step 0: Count the number of job posts from the input
    - save total count: n
    . With each job, assign a number from 1 to n 
    - loop through each job from 1 to n
    - for each job go through steps 1 to 15.
    - The number of final CSV rows must exactly match the number of job posts.

    Step 1: Extract the company name.
    - This field can not be empty
    - if not found give the best guest from the job
    - Save as: "company_name"

    Step 3: Extract the job title.
    - Wrap the title in quotation marks: "Data Analyst - Data Engineer"
    - This field can not be empty
    - if not found give the best guest from the job
    - Save as: "job_title"

    Step 4: Extract the city.
    - Do not include "US", "USA", or "United States"
    - Must not include country names

    - Must not include country names
    - Do not include "US", "USA", or "United States"
    - If not found, make the best guess from the job post, if still not found, output "NaN"
    - Save as: "state"

    Step 6: Extract the employment type.
    - Must be One of: Full time, Part time, Contract, Internship, Temporary
    - If not found, output "NaN"
    - Exclude ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù or ‚ÄúOnsite‚Äù

    - Save as: "seniority_level"

    Step 8: Extract the minimum salary.
    - Numeric only, no $ or commas
    - If not found, make the best guess from the job post, otherwise, output "NaN"
    - Save as: "min_salary"

    Step 9: Extract the maximum salary.
    - Same rules as minimum
    - If not found, make the best guess from the job post, otherwise, output "NaN"

    - Save as: "applicant_count"

    Step 12: Extract the job link (ending with job ID only).
    - For instance: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4191528049/?tracking ‚Üí https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4191528049
    - No parameters
